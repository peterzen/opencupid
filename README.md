# OpenCupid

OpenCupid is a free and open matchmaking application built to serve existing communities.

Within every circle — whether that’s a collective, association, ecovillage or shared-interest group — there are countless valuable connections waiting to happen. Yet in real life, many of these remain hidden because the existing social network platforms don't facilitate discovery and members are often scattered all over the place. OpenCupid helps surface these connections in a safe and intentional way, connections that can evolve into meaningful bonds — whether that’s friendship, collaboration, or romantic partnership — within circles they already belong to.  

At its core, the platform is privacy-preserving and based on reciprocity: you only see the details others choose to share if you’ve shared the same information yourself, and only if your preferences match theirs. Consent is fundamental: nobody can approach you unless you’ve explicitly given permission. This creates a safer, more respectful environment where connections grow on mutual terms.  

Unlike commercial matchmaking apps, OpenCupid is free from dark patterns and manipulative design. There are no hidden algorithms trying to keep you hooked, no upsells, and no data exploitation. Just a simple, transparent tool that communities can use to connect their members in an open, fair, and trust-first way.
